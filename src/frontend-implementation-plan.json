Introduce local state (e.g., noHidden/noRemoved) to track whether “No” has been activated; render a normal focusable button (or RomanticButton for consistent styling) labeled “No” only while not hidden. On first activation (click/tap/keyboard), set the hidden state so the “No” button is no longer rendered; ensure this action does not change the existing response state and therefore does not trigger the celebration overlay or the “I’ll wait patiently 💕” view. Keep “Yes 💖” and “Let Me Think 😊” labels and handlers exactly as they are."
