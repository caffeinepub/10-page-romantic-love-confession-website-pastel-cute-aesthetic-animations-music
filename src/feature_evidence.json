When the user clicks/taps/keyboard-activates “No” one time, hide/remove the “No” button so that only the two remaining options (“Yes 💖” and “Let Me Think 😊”) are shown. This new behavior must fully replace the current runaway + unclickable behavior, and the existing “Yes 💖” and “Let Me Think 😊” labels and behaviors must remain unchanged.",
